### Question 1

Note: lm_robust and feols seem to calculate clustered standard errors differently. Feols matches those from the paper, but I've use both based on convenience and when I don't have a standard error to match I defer to lm_robust. 

#### a)

```{r}
# Generate treatment dummy and city/cycle pair for clustering
election_df %<>% mutate(post = if_else(cycle >= 2017, 1, 0), 
                        treatment = if_else(city == 'Seattle', 1, 0),
                        city_cycle = as.factor(city):as.factor(cycle),
                        seattle = if_else(city == 'Seattle', 1, 0))

# Run naive regression
election_df %>% lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ treatment + At_Large*Special,., clusters = city_cycle)
```

#### b)

```{r}
# Before and after treatment for seattle
(before_after_seattle = election_df |> filter(city == 'Seattle') %>%
  lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ post + At_Large*Special,., clusters = city_cycle))

# Before and after for non-seattle cities
(before_after_other = election_df |> filter(city != 'Seattle') %>%
  lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ post + At_Large*Special,., clusters = city_cycle))

# Diff between
summary(before_after_seattle)$coefficients[2,1] - summary(before_after_other)$coefficients[2,1]
```

#### c)

```{r}
# Cross sectional estimate before 2017
(cross_before = election_df |> filter(post == 0) %>%
  lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ seattle + At_Large*Special,., clusters = city_cycle))

# Cross-Sectional Estimate after 2017
(cross_after = election_df |> filter(post == 1) %>%
  lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ seattle + At_Large*Special,., clusters = city_cycle))

# Diff between
summary(cross_after)$coefficients[2,1] - summary(cross_before)$coefficients[2,1]
```


#### d)

```{r}
# Diff-in-Diff
election_df %>% lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ post*treatment + At_Large*Special,., clusters = city_cycle) # 2.8

# Coeff of interest is post:treatment
```

#### e)

```{r}
# two way fixed effects. We're switching regression functions here because it has prettier output, and seems to calculate standard errors in a slightly different way that matches the paper
election_df %>% feols(candidates_ballot ~ post*treatment | as.factor(city) + as.factor(cycle) + At_Large*Special,., cluster = "city_cycle") # Point estimate and se match

# Coeff of interest is post:treatment
```

#### f)

```{r}
# Test for parallel pre-trends with city fixed effects
election_df |> filter(post == 0 ) |> 
  mutate(`cycle*seattle` = cycle*seattle) %>%
  lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ `cycle*seattle` + At_Large*Special + as.factor(city),., clusters = city_cycle)

# Without city fixed effects
election_df |> filter(post == 0 ) |> 
  mutate(`cycle*seattle` = cycle*seattle) %>%
  lm_robust(candidates_ballot ~ `cycle*seattle` + At_Large*Special,., clusters = city_cycle)
```

#### g)

```{r}
# Estimate non-parallel trends test
election_df |> mutate(`seattle*cycle` = seattle*cycle, `seattle*post` = seattle*post) %>%
  feols(candidates_ballot ~ cycle +  `seattle*cycle` + `seattle*post` + At_Large*Special + as.factor(city),., cluster = "city_cycle")

# Coef of interest is seattle*post
```

#### h)

```{r}
# Define cities in washington
washington = c('Bellevue', 'Everett', 'Seattle', 'Spokane', 'Tacome', 'Vancouver')

# Run part g again but only with cities in washington
election_df |> filter(city %in% washington) |> 
  mutate(`seattle*cycle` = seattle*cycle, `seattle*post` = seattle*post) %>%
  feols(candidates_ballot ~ cycle +  `seattle*cycle` + `seattle*post` + At_Large*Special + as.factor(city),., cluster = "city_cycle")

# Now just with california cities
election_df |> filter((!city %in% washington) | city == 'Seattle') |> 
  mutate(`seattle*cycle` = seattle*cycle, `seattle*post` = seattle*post) %>%
  feols(candidates_ballot ~ cycle +  `seattle*cycle` + `seattle*post` + At_Large*Special + as.factor(city),., cluster = "city_cycle")
```
